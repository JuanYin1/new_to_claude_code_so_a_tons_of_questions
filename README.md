# Conda-Lovers' Paradise 🐍🌴
Let Claude Code help you decide which VM env to use!

Welcome to the ultimate sanctuary for Conda fanatics who hate dependency chaos! This repo is built with the sole purpose of **keeping your Python worlds nicely isolated, one Conda environment at a time**. No more “it works on my machine” nightmares or mystery conflicts.

### What’s inside?

- Your automated environment setup script 🛠️ — creates/activates the perfect Conda env tailored to this project, create a new env if needed.
- `CLAUDE.md` magic 🧙‍♂️ — tells Claude Code exactly which Conda env to summon, no more guessing games.
- All the cool code you want to run, without messing up your global Python playground.

### Why choose this repo?

- Love Conda? You’re already halfway there! This repo won’t ask you to download Conda — you’re assumed to be a Conda Jedi.
- No more pip-install-everywhere madness 🤪.
- Perfect separation of worlds so your Mac (or PC) stays clean and happy 🧼.

### How to get started

1. Make sure you installed Claude Code in any of the env, and start with that env (if you haven't installed the Claude code yet, [click_here_to_install](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart)): 
    ```bash
    conda activate <env_with_Claude_Code>

2. Clone this repo (duh), pwd the file path:
   
   ```bash
   /path/to/choose_conda_env.py
3. Clone the repo you wanna use Clade Code in, pwd the folder path:
   ```bash
   /path/to/cloned_repo
4. Run the command — it’ll pick or create the perfect Conda environment on the fly.:
   ```bash
   python </path/to/choose_conda_env.py> </path/to/cloned_repo>
5. Go to your cloned_repo, start using Claude with command:
   ```bash
   Claude
6. Watch Claude Code use the right environment like a boss, all thanks to `CLAUDE.md`.

### Pro tip ⚡

Running code in the right Conda environment is the new black. Forget global installs. Stay stylish, stay isolated.

Happy Conda-ing! 🚀
